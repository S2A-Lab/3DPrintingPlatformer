  - You must be the new intern here at S.A.M Technologies Inc.
  - S.A.M stands for Smart Additive Manufacturing.
  - We are developing the 3D printers of tomorrow. Here let me show you...
  - TADA! Project PrintPort!
  - This is our newest prototype for our revolutionary portable 3D printer.
  - Oh my... look at the time...
  - "I need to run a systems check on the upper floors. Power's been... temperamental.
    Stay put, get familiar with the PrintPort \u2014 and, for the love of science,
